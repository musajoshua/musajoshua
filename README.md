### Hi there 👋🏾, my name is Musa Joshua

I am a full-stack software engineer and a graduate of Computer Science from Landmark University. I am enthusiastic about technology 
and enjoy developing scale-able and practical solutions 
to real-life problems.
Outside tech, I am a huge soccer and basketball fan. 
I am also passionate about photography, particularly 
fine-art and nature.
