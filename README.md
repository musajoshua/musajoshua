### Hi there 👋🏾, my name is Musa Joshua

I am a versatile Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience in front-end development with JavaScript, TypeScript, Redux.js, and React.js. 
With a Computer Science academic background and solid math and coding skills, I have consistently optimized solutions and solved complex technical challenges individually and in collaboration with other teams remotely.
In addition, I combine end-to-end testing knowledge with hands-on experience translating UI designs for mobile and desktop solutions.
Outside tech, I am a huge soccer and basketball fan. 
I am also passionate about photography, particularly 
fine-art and nature.
