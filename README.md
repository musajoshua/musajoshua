### Hi there 👋🏾, my name is Joshua

I am a versatile software engineer with 5+ years of experience, coupled with a solid academic background in Computer Science and proficient math and problem-solving skills.

I am liberal, open-minded, and believe everything is relative. I love simplicity but enjoy complex concepts.

Other than tech, I love traveling and exploring the world, watching soccer (Liverpool fan) and NBA (LA Lakers fan), and listening to music. 
I am also passionate about photography, particularly fine art and nature.
